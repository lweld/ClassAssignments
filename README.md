Here's some basic python programs I wrote for a CS class. Enjoy!

The Adventure Game uses decision trees to route the user through the streets of Tokyo. For example, enter 'R' to run, 'F' to fight -- it's the classic old game.

The Canada Post program calculates the cost of shipping an inputted item.

The Calculator allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide any two numbers they like, as many times as they like (it also gives the user an error message if they try to divide by a zero).

The Credit Card program takes an 8 digit credit card number and performs various calculations on the card number.
