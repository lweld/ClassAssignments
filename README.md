Here's some basic Python programs I wrote for a CS class. Enjoy!

Treasure hunt is a game where the user enters a position number and depending on if it's a treasure, another index position number, or out of bounds, they win the treasure amount, are sent to another position on the board, or lose all their winnings.

The Crown Anchor Game simulates the betting game, Crown & Anchors.

The Canada Post program calculates the cost of shipping an inputted item.

The Calculator allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide any two numbers they like, as many times as they like (it also gives the user an error message if they try to divide by a zero).

The Credit Card program takes an 8 digit credit card number and performs various calculations on the card number.

The Parse Hamlet program takes a passage from Hamlet and returns the number of times each word is repeated in the passage.
