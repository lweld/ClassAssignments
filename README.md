Here's some basic python programs I wrote for a CS class. Enjoy!

The Adventure Game uses decision trees to route the user through the streets of Tokyo. For example, enter 'R' to run, 'F' to fight -- it's the classic old game.

The Canada Post program calculates the cost of shipping an inputted item.

The Calculator allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide any two numbers they like, as many times as they like (it also gives the user an error message if they try to divide by a zero).

The Credit Card program takes an 8 digit credit card number and performs the following operations on the card number:
  1. Starting from the rightmost digit, it sums every second number
  2. Starting from the leftmost digit, it doubles every number, then breaks up each number and sums them (e.g., 8 doubled becomes 16, which becomes 1 and 6, then 1 + 6 = 7)
  3. Adds the results of the two preceding steps
